The app can be accessed at: https://museum-dashboard.herokuapp.com/index

The dashboard displays the Stastics of Museum data for the state of Washington, D.C.

The data is collected from the Data Catalog maintained by Institute of Museum and Library Services (https://data.imls.gov/).

I created the dashboard using dashing.rb using Ruby on Rails.Check out http://shopify.github.com/dashing for more information.
